## Why This Matters

- Repetition builds trust.
- Repetition builds recognition.
- Repetition builds brand memory.
- Not in a marketing way, in a shepherding way.

### Simple Rule

If a page feels like it’s missing a soul, add the tagline. It carries your theology in one sentence.

### Website Flow Concept

**Question:** If someone lands brokenhearted and overwhelmed, what is the gentlest path from “I’m hurting” → “I feel safe” → “I know what to do next”?

- Not funnels
- Not complexity
- Just shepherding

### Builder Note

“I want a simple shepherding flow:

- Home → Program → Discernment Call
- Home → First Light → Request Support No complicated funnels. No popups. No pressure.”
